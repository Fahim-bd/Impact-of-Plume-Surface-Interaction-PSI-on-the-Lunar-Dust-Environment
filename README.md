# Impact-of-Plume-Surface-Interaction-PSI-on-the-Lunar-Dust-Environment
My work investigates how rocket plume exhaust interacts with lunar soil during lander operations. Using DSMC simulation methods,  potential effects on the lunar environment due to plume-surface interaction (PSI) will be analyzed.
